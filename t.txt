Hooks - Functional Component
Providing the smart component features in Dumb by using Hooks

Functional Component main role -Presentaion

Class Based Components - Presentaion + state + refs + life cycle

But using hooks in functional component - state handle + refs + life cycle

REASON:::
Class are Heavy - Inherit from Component (state, refs, life cycle, props)

Hooks injecting what u want - so functional component are light

1. this.refs
2. this.setState
3. this.fn.bind(this)
Developer must know this , bind
So functional component (Arrow Based) not having this, bind
Classes are poor to minify


Input Ways
1. Event Bind (onChange)
Ref use
1. String ref (old and deprected)
2. React.createRef - we get ref reference variable - Smart
3. useRef Hook - Functional Component
4. CallBack Ref -



Event Bind
this.eventName.bind(this);
Arrow Function
